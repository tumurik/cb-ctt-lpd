Winner of itc2007. Comapre with track 3. 
But I did not implement all soft constraints and tested only on comp01.ctt due to lack of time.

MÃ¼ller's approach is a hybrid algorithm.
It initiates with Iterative Forward Search (IFS) + Conflict-based Statistics (CBS).
And balance Hill Climbing (HC), Great Deluge (GD) and Simulated Annealing (SA) to improve results.
